## Conlusion and Next Steps

In conclusion, we advise that our company moves forward with its content-creation venture. Furthermore, we advise that drama is the most popular genre by public opinion, and that both drama and action earn well in the box office and thereby would properly return our investment. As an additional recommendation, Robert Downey Jr. would be the preferred choice of leading actor. Supplementarily speaking, animation might also be an applicable genre bringing us the best of all three worlds of popularity, budget-conscious, and star-power.
