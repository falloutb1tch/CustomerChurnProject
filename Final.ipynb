    "While a certain amount of churn is unavoidable, businesses strive to bring churn to as low a level as possible. It is cheaper and thus more profitable to keep existing customers rather than lure in new ones. So, our company was employed to determined causes of churn and which of those causes had the most impact on (Client Redacted). Specifically, as we begin 2024, it is wise to keep in mind the changing social landscape around us. I do not know a single person without a cell phone unless they are a very young child, but I know many people without a landline, or only a cursory one that they got along with their internet or cable television package. Therefore, this project will continue under the assumption we are speaking of a cellular telephone company rather than one offering landline services."

    "This public dataset is provided by the CrowdAnalytix community as part of their churn prediction competition. The real name of the telecom company is anonymized. It contains 20 predictor variables mostly about customer usage patterns. There are 3333 records in this dataset, out of which 483 customers are churners and the remaining 2850 are non-churners. Thus, the ratio of churners in this dataset is 14%. Our first real steps at understanding our data, outside of the metadata we have, is performing a .head(), .describe() and .info() to see some basic statistics about our data."

Data leakage occurs when that is not the case, and the model has been \"trained\" on \"testing\" data.

Recall that we have applied no regularization to these logistic regression models, as seen where the code displays penalty='none'. It is advised to begin with L2 (Ridge) regularization, and so that is where we will begin as well."
