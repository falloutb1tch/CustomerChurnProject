    "While a certain amount of churn is unavoidable, businesses strive to bring churn to as low a level as possible. In essence, they'd like to keep their customers if they can. So, our company was employed to determined causes of churn and which of those causes had the most impact on (Client Redacted). Specifically, as we begin 2024, it is wise to keep in mind the changing social landscape around us. I do not know a single person without a cell phone unless they are a very young child, but I know many people without a landline, or only a cursory one that they got along with their internet or cable television package. Therefore, this project will continue under the assumption we are speaking of a cellular telephone company rather than one offering landline services."

    "This public dataset is provided by the CrowdAnalytix community as part of their churn prediction competition. The real name of the telecom company is anonymized. It contains 20 predictor variables mostly about customer usage patterns. There are 3333 records in this dataset, out of which 483 customers are churners and the remaining 2850 are non-churners. Thus, the ratio of churners in this dataset is 14%. Our first real steps at understanding our data, outside of the metadata we have, is performing a .head(), .describe() and .info() to see some basic statistics about our data."

Recall that \"churning\" is to stop doing business with the company, so in this case, that column tells us whether the customer still does business with (Client Redacted). These explorations also tell us that we have 21 columns with 3333 entries each, and no null values. Furthermore, our data types include objects, integers, and one Boolean column."

    "This means that whilst we do have a binary classification problem on our hands, very suitable for logistic regression, we also have a class imbalance. Obviously, we will not be able to accurately predict anything with only 14% of a category of data available to us. We will deal with this using a technique called SMOTE which allows us to, at our discretion, oversample the minority or undersample the majority, or both. It is not recommended to undersample the majority as it amounts to leaving data on the table, and so we will be oversampling the minority in this case. However, we will revisit this topic, as I intend to use SMOTE within a pipeline."

Similarly, I felt that all of the data contained within number of calls dependent on time of day or international was also contained within the minutes columns, and so chose to keep those instead."

Data leakage occurs when that is not the case, and the model has been \"trained\" on \"testing\" data.
